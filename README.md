OSEF.js - the JS framework that everyone doesn't care ;)
=========================================================

*Please note that this a work-in-progress, and things are currently in pre-alpha mode.*

The goal of this project is to create a framework based on [Event Sourcing](https://github.com/eventstore/eventstore/wiki/Event-Sourcing-Basics) patterns, written in pure [ES6](http://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/) code.

1. To set your environment (npm must be installed):

        npm install

2. To build the framework code:

        grunt build:framework

3. To build & launch the test application:

        grunt testapp

4. To run tests using Karma:

        npm test
